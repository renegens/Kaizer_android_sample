Android Clean Architecture Project README

This repository contains an Android project developed using Clean Architecture principles. Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that helps create scalable, maintainable, and testable applications by separating concerns and dependencies. This project follows the principles of Clean Architecture to ensure a robust and flexible Android application.

Project Overview

The Android application in this project serves as a template for building feature-rich, maintainable apps with a clear separation of concerns. The primary goals of the Clean Architecture approach are:

Independence of Frameworks: The core business logic and use cases are decoupled from the Android framework. This enables easier migration between Android versions or even to other platforms.
Testability: Clean Architecture promotes the writing of unit tests for the core business logic without relying on Android components. This ensures high test coverage and better code quality.
Maintainability: The separation of concerns and clear boundaries between layers make the codebase easier to understand, update, and maintain.
Architecture Overview

The project follows the following architectural layers:

Presentation Layer: Contains the UI components, including Activities, Compose Files, and ViewModels.
It is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying data fetched from the domain layer.
Domain Layer: This layer holds the core business logic, including use cases, entities, and
interfaces defining business rules. It is independent of the presentation and data layers.
Data Layer: The data layer deals with data access and storage. It implements the interfaces defined
in the domain layer and provides data from local or remote data sources (e.g., databases, APIs).
Dependency Injection (DI): The project uses a DI framework (e.g., Dagger, Koin) to manage the
dependencies between these layers and promote the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and
Dependency Inversion.

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using Git:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/renegens/Kaizer_android_sample.git
Open the project using Android Studio.
Build the project to download all dependencies.
Run the application on an emulator or physical device.
Dependencies

The project uses various external libraries to implement different features. Some of the key
dependencies include:

Compose UI
AndroidX libraries
Retrofit for network communication
Room for local database storage
ViewModel and Flow for handling UI-related data
Dependency Injection framework (Hilt)
Please refer to the build.gradle files for a comprehensive list of dependencies and their versions.

Testing

TBD

bash
Copy code
./gradlew test
